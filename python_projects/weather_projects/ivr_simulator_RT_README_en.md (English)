🔥 IVR System RT – Fraud Prevention & Risk Analysis 🔥

📌 Overview 🚀 This IVR system is designed to enhance security, detect fraud, and optimize risk categorization dynamically. With adaptive fraud prevention mechanisms, metadata-driven profiling, and real-time IVR simulation, it sets a new standard for secure automated interactions. 🏆

🦾 IVR Fraud Detection Flow
📞 Caller Input ───▶ 🎙️ IVR Menu Prompt

          ▼  
🔍 Risk Evaluation ───▶ 🛡️ Fraud Detection (Metadata Profiling)  
          │

🚨 High-Risk Caller ───▶ 🔄 Adaptive Risk Categorization  
          │  
          ▼  
✅ Verified Caller ───▶ 📊 Secure Call Logging  
🚀 How It Works: 1️⃣ Caller enters the IVR system and interacts with the menu. 2️⃣ Risk evaluation engine analyzes metadata to classify potential fraud threats. 3️⃣ If the risk is high, the system triggers security escalation & adaptive profiling. 4️⃣ If the risk is low, the caller proceeds through standard IVR authentication. 5️⃣ All actions are logged for tracking fraud detection effectiveness.

💯 Core Components 🔹 📞 ivr_simulator_RT.py – Real-time fraud detection & IVR automation 🚀 🔹 📝 ivr_system_RT.log – Structured logging for fraud monitoring & risk analysis 🛡️

🔥 Key Features 🤖 IVR Simulator RT (ivr_simulator_RT.py) ✅ 🚨 Advanced Fraud Detection – Flags suspicious calls using behavioral profiling. ✅ 🔄 Adaptive Risk Analysis – Dynamically adjusts security thresholds in real-time. ✅ 🛡️ Secure API Integration – Implements encrypted communication for high-risk assessments. ✅ 📊 Metadata-Driven Analysis – Uses caller interaction data to predict potential fraud risks.

📊 IVR System RT Logging (ivr_system_RT.log) 📝 📡 Real-Time Call Monitoring – Tracks every IVR session dynamically. 🚨 🔍 Fraud Detection Reports – Logs suspicious activity based on risk levels. 🔧 📂 Structured Risk Evaluation – Documents adaptive thresholds for fraud mitigation.
