🚀 IVR System RT
📌 Overview
The IVR System RT comprises two key components:

📞 ivr_simulator_RT.py – A real-time IVR simulation tool designed for fraud detection, adaptive risk analysis, and metadata-driven profiling. It analyzes caller interactions to enhance security and automate responses.

📝 ivr_system_RT.log – The logging system for the IVR Simulator RT, designed to track real-time events, record fraud detection results, and document adaptive risk analysis. It provides valuable insights for debugging and security monitoring.

🔥 Features
IVR Simulator RT (ivr_simulator_RT.py)
✅ Fraud Detection – Identifies suspicious behavior using metadata analysis. ✅ Adaptive Risk Analysis – Dynamically adjusts risk thresholds based on caller input. ✅ Customizable Call Flow – Modify IVR responses based on real-time conditions. ✅ Secure API Integration – Supports encrypted communication for risk assessment.

📝 IVR System RT Logging (ivr_system_RT.log)
📝 Real-time Logging – Captures IVR events dynamically. 🔍 Fraud Detection Tracking – Logs security alerts based on behavior profiling. 📊 Adaptive Risk Analysis Reports – Documents risk evaluations for each call. 📂 Metadata-Driven Behavior Profiling – Stores caller interaction details for analysis.

⚡ Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

bash
git clone https://github.com/rene644/Projects.git
cd Projects/IVR_Project
pip install -r requirements.txt
🚀 Usage
Running the IVR Simulator
Run the IVR simulator:

bash
python ivr_simulator_RT.py --config ivr_simulator_RT.json
🛠️ Optional Arguments
⚙️ Argument	🔹 Description
--config	Specifies the JSON configuration file
--verbose	Enables detailed logging output
--test-mode	Runs the IVR system in simulation mode
⚙️ Configuration
📌 IVR Simulator Configuration (ivr_simulator_RT.json)
Modify ivr_simulator_RT.json to customize: 🛡️ Risk thresholds & fraud detection parameters 📝 Caller metadata tracking & behavioral profiling 🔧 Logging preferences for adaptive risk evaluation

📝 IVR System RT Log Format (ivr_system_RT.log)
The log follows a structured format. Here’s an example of manual input:

txt
📞 [2025-04-24 18:42:17] CALL STARTED - Caller ID: 1234567890  
🚨 [2025-04-24 18:42:20] FRAUD ALERT - Risk Score: HIGH  
🔄 [2025-04-24 18:42:25] ACTION TAKEN - Caller redirected for verification  
✅ [2025-04-24 18:43:10] CALL ENDED - Duration: 53 seconds  
Ensure manual entries follow a timestamped structure for consistency.

🛠️ How to Use the Log
1️⃣ Open ivr_system_RT.log in a text editor. 2️⃣ Add manual entries in the format shown above. 3️⃣ Save and track call activity manually when needed.

💯 Customization
📂 Customizing Log Entries (ivr_system_RT.log)
Modify log entries to include: 👤 Caller metadata (e.g., name, risk level). ⚡ System actions (e.g., authentication steps, call routing). 🚨 Fraud indicators (e.g., flagged behavior, verification status).
